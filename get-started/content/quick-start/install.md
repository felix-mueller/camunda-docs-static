First you need to set up your development environment and install the Camunda BPM Platform and the Camunda Modeler.


# Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

* Java Runtime Environment 1.7+

You can verify this by using your terminal, shell or command line:

```sh
java -version
```


# Camunda BPM Platform

First, download a distribution of the Camunda BPM platform. You can choose from different distributions for various application servers. In this tutorial, we will use the Apache Tomcat based distribution. Download it from [the download page](https://camunda.com/download).

After having downloaded the distribution, unpack it inside a directory of your choice.

After you have successfully unpacked your distribution of the Camunda BPM platform, execute the script named `start-camunda.bat` (for Windows users), respectively `start-camunda.sh` (for Unix users).

This script will start the application server and open a welcome screen in your web browser. If the page does not open, go to [http://localhost:8080/camunda-welcome/index.html](http://localhost:8080/camunda-welcome/index.html).


# Camunda Modeler

Download the Camunda Modeler from [the download page](https://camunda.com/download/modeler/).

After having downloaded the modeler, just unzip the download in a folder of your choice.

After you have successfully unpacked the zip, run `camunda-modeler.exe` (for Windows users), respectively `camunda-modeler.app` (for Mac users) or `camunda-modeler.sh` (for Linux users).
